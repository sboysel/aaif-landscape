# AAIF Agentic AI Landscape

The [AAIF](https://aaif.io) Agentic AI [Landscape](https://landscape.aaif.io) is intended to provided a view into the overall agentic AI landscape including AAIF mebmers and projects. We categorize many of the most promenant open source software and open standards projects in agentic AI.

This repository contains the data files and images required to generate the [AAIF landscape](https://landscape.aaif.io). The software that generates it can be found at the [cncf/landscape2](https://github.com/cncf/landscape2) repository. Please see its [README file](https://github.com/cncf/landscape2#landscape2) for more information about how it works.

## New entries

To add a new entry to the landscape, please open a pull request to add it in alphabetical order to the [landscape.yml](landscape.yml) file. The logo must be added to the `hosted_logos` directory (in SVG format) and referenced from the `logo` field.

Before submitting a new entry it is important to review the following guidelines:

* Open source projects with at least 1000 GitHub stars that clearly fit in an existing category are generally included. Put the project in the single category where it best fits.
* We generally will only list an organizations project in one box, to represent its major or best-known offering. We occasionally make exceptions for large companies. Note that if we allowed listing the same product or project in multiple boxes.
* We are generally not including commercial versions of open source software.
* We do not include closed source products and services or proprietary standards.  Closed soure products that implement open source solultions are also not included.
* Crunchbase organization should be the company or organization that controls the software. That is normally the owner of the trademark, whether or not a trademark has been formally filed.
* Your project or company needs a logo in SVG format:
  * Logos must include the company, product or project name in English. It's fine to also include words from another language.
  * Don't use reversed logos (i.e. with a non-white, non-transparent background color).
  * When multiple variants exist, use stacked (not horizontal) logos.

> [!NOTE]
> At the moment the landscape is generated daily, so once your PR is merged your changes should be visible before 24 hours.

## Extra fields

The `extra` section in the landscape.yml file allows you to include various fields to provide essential details about your project. This section helps users understand the project's purpose and find more information. For a detailed list of possible fields please refer to the [Extra Fields Documentation](https://github.com/cncf/landscape2/blob/main/docs/config/data.yml).
